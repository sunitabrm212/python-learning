#Polymorphism = many forms, object has many forms
#same function having multiple forms.
#static typing: at compile time defining the data type of variables (defining data types before use in variables)
#dynamic typing: not defining data type of variables( dynamic in python)

# print(len("Sunita"))
# list=[1,3.4,"Sunita"]
# print(len(list)) #Here len function works different for string and list
